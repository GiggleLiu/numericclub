# Best Tutorial Codes - Collection
A piece of good tutorial code can open you a new world, except those appear in [Numeric Club talks](/talks/archive/), there are many other good tutorial codes all over the world.
Here is a collection of best tutorial codes

### Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG)
[https://github.com/simple-dmrg/simple-dmrg](https://github.com/simple-dmrg/simple-dmrg)

It uses 100 lines of Python codes grasp every key ingradients of DMRG.
Simple, with low abstraction makes it suited for tutorial.
You can find both Python and Julia realization in this repository.

### Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE)
The source code can be downloaded from Anders W. Sandvik's home page

[http://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/](http://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/)

With 500 lines of Fortran code, he opened a new field. This powerful code solved a lot of important problems in condensed matter field theory.
Everyone knows SSE is the shorthand for "Sandvik's Smart Expansion".

### Time Evolving Block Decimation (TEBD)
[https://github.com/galakto/for1807-TPS](https://github.com/galakto/for1807-TPS)

Author Frank Pollmann can use simplist code to achieve most amazing results.
His TEBD code not only teaches me about method itself, but also examplifies a good way to write easy to understand tutorial codes.

### ANN as wave-function ansatz
You can learn a lot from Carleo's C++ codes as a supplimentary material of his science paper

[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6325/602/tab-figures-data](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6325/602/tab-figures-data)

It covers variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM).
In fact, he managed to make it a github repository later: https://github.com/netket/netket (mabye nolonger suited for tutorial)
