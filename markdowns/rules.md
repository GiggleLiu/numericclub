3. click <a href='#' class='btn btn-sm'><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus">Talk</a> after a topic to contribute a talk,
4. write tutorial code, with a `README.md` (under root folder, so that v2nobel can find it) file,
push it to [github](https://github.com/), add its github url (e.g. `https://github.com/GiggleLiu/marburg`) to your talk,
5. when, your talk is ready, click <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning">ready</a> under your talk to make it appear in the main page of v2nobel,
A talk should be published at least **48 hours** before it starts, **github link** under your topic should not be empty when you publish it,
5. Download this self **introduction & payment** [ppt](/static/other/intro.pptx)/[pdf](/static/other/intro.pdf), modify and make it the last page of your presentation.

#### Stage 2: Offline Talk
1. setup your computer before the talk. If the Room is closed,
knock the door of Room 812 (Mr. Wang)/828 (Mr. Meng) to ask for help, if no response, knock harder.
2. give a talk
3. if next speaker is not decided, decide next speaker.

#### Stage 3: Finally
